1. THE PROBLEM DEFINITION:

The hospital aims to develop an AI-based system that can predict the likelihood of a patient being readmitted within 30 days after discharge.
High readmission rates can indicate poor care quality, increase healthcare costs, and negatively impact patient outcomes.
The hospital wants to proactively identify high-risk patients to enable timely interventions that can reduce unnecessary readmissions.


2. OBJECTIVES:

- Build a predictive model to classify patients as high or low readmission risk.

- Improve patient care by enabling targeted follow-ups and preventive measures for high-risk patients.

- Reduce hospital readmission rates to comply with healthcare regulations and improve hospital performance.

- Assist healthcare providers in making data-driven decisions for post-discharge care planning.


3. STAKEHOLDERS:

(i) Patients: Benefit from improved care, targeted follow-up, and reduced complications.

(ii) Doctors and Nurses: Use predictions to adjust discharge planning and provide appropriate aftercare instructions.

(iii) Hospital Administrators: Benefit from reduced readmission penalties and improved hospital ratings.

(iv) Data Scientists / AI Engineers: Responsible for building, validating, and maintaining the predictive model.

(v) Health Insurance Providers: Interested in cost reduction through better patient management and fewer readmissions.

(vi) Regulatory Bodies: Ensure the hospital meets required healthcare quality standards.
