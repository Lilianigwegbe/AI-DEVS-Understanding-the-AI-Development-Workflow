To make sure the model performs well not just on training data but also in the real world, we’ll take a few steps:

Use cross-validation to make sure our results hold up across different chunks of data.

Limit complexity – For example, in Random Forest, we can limit the depth of each tree or require more data per split.

Keep only useful features – Drop anything that doesn’t add value to the prediction.

Regularly update the model with new patient data so it stays relevant and accurate over time.
