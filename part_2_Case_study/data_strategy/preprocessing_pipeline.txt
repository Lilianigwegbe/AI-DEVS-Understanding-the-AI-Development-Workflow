PREPROCESSING PIPELINE:


Step 1. Data Collection:
 -Gather data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs), patient demographics, discharge summaries, and social health data.


Step 2. Data Cleaning:

 -Remove or impute missing values.

 -Correct errors like incorrect dates or out-of-range vital signs.

 -Drop duplicate records.


Step 3. Data Transformation
 -Encode categorical variables:

   *Gender → Binary encoding (Male: 0, Female: 1)

    *Diagnosis codes → One-hot encoding or embeddings.

 -Scale numerical features:

   *Normalize lab results and vital signs to ensure balanced feature contributions.


Step 4. Feature Engineering:

 -Create new features such as:

   *Number of previous admissions in the last 12 months.

   *Length of hospital stay.

   *Time since last discharge.

    *Medication complexity score.

 -Aggregate features:
    *like average blood pressure during the hospital stay.

    *Average vital signs over the last hospital stay.

    *Total number of chronic diseases.


Step 5. Data Splitting:

 -Divide data into training, validation, and testing sets (e.g., 70% training, 15% validation, 15% testing).


Step 6. Handling Class Imbalance:

 -Apply techniques like SMOTE to balance the dataset if readmissions are rare.
