ETHICAL CONCERNS:

(a) Patient Privacy and Data Security:
 -Health records contain highly sensitive personal information.

 -Concern: Ensuring that patient data is anonymized, encrypted, and securely stored to comply with data protection laws like HIPAA.


(b) Bias and Fairness:
 -Models can unintentionally inherit biases present in the training data (e.g., unequal care for certain demographics).

 -Concern: The model must be tested and monitored for bias against age, gender, ethnicity, or socioeconomic groups to ensure fair predictions.
