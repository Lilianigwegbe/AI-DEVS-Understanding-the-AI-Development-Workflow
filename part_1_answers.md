# AI Development Workflow – Part 1: Short Answer Questions

## 1. Problem Definition 

**AI Problem:**  
Predicting equipment failure in a manufacturing plant using sensor data.

**Objectives:**
1. Minimize unplanned downtime by forecasting machine failures.
2. Reduce maintenance costs through predictive maintenance strategies.
3. Improve overall equipment efficiency (OEE) across production lines.

**Stakeholders:**
- Plant operations manager  
- Maintenance engineering team

**Key Performance Indicator (KPI):**  
**Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)** – a higher MTBF indicates improved equipment reliability.

## 2. Data Collection & Preprocessing 

**Data Sources:**
1. Sensor data from machines (temperature, vibration, pressure, etc.).
2. Historical maintenance logs detailing failures and servicing.

**Potential Bias:**  
Sensors on older machines may be less accurate or may have missing data, leading to biased predictions favoring newer equipment.

**Preprocessing Steps:**
1. Handle missing sensor readings via imputation or interpolation.
2. Normalize continuous variables (e.g., temperature, RPM) to standardize scale.
3. Encode categorical features like machine type and maintenance status.

## 3. Model Development 

**Chosen Model:** Random Forest  
**Justification:**  
- Handles high-dimensional sensor data well  
- Resistant to overfitting  
- Offers feature importance insights useful for diagnosing key failure indicators

**Data Splitting:**
- **70%** training  
- **15%** validation  
- **15%** test

**Hyperparameters to Tune:**
1. `n_estimators` – affects the number of trees and predictive strength.
2. `max_features` – controls the number of features considered at each split, impacting generalization.

## 4. Evaluation & Deployment 

**Evaluation Metrics:**
1. **Precision:** Important to avoid false positives that could trigger unnecessary maintenance.
2. **Recall:** Critical to catch as many true failures as possible to prevent downtime.

**Concept Drift:**  
Changes in machine behavior due to wear, new parts, or production adjustments may cause data drift.  
**Monitoring Strategy:**  
Set up periodic model retraining and monitor real-time accuracy through dashboards.

**Technical Challenge – Scalability:**  
Processing large volumes of high-frequency sensor data in real-time may require streaming infrastructure (e.g., Apache Kafka + Spark) for scalable, low-latency predictions.
